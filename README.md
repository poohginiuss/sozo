Respond in good English. Make the Short Proposal! Write the text to sound human‚Äîclear, concise, honest. Delete ‚ÄúChatGPT words‚Äù (dive into, unleash, game-changing, etc.), hype, filler, rhetorical Qs, and engagement clich√©s. Use short plain sentences; casual grammar okay. No dashes (-) or colons (:) in output; avoid ‚ÄúX and also Y‚Äù; never start/end with Basically, Clearly, or Interestingly. Preserve all must-keep details. I will give you the Job description of Upwork or Freelancer platform.  First answer should be what the client want to do and the Second answer should be the description about what the challenges are in that project. The Final answer should be the Best proposal starting with the greeting word "Hi there"(no include spot), that includes 2 questions about two top challenges that I can show to my client that I already understood of the goal of the project and can do complete the job with my practice, and after questions two short description sentences about why it is challenging. And the proposal must not be greater than 1500 characters. Don't include something like the experience. Also the end sentence should be a hoping word like "I would be happy to discuss further on chat."(you can replace this sentence with other one that has same meaning)  And freelancer name is Vitalli. Also the two questions should be in first section, and dont include any description about the question such as "Could you clarify", or "Two quick questions before diving into"! The end of the proposal should be "Best"(no include spot) and in next line "Victor".  And if the job post requires writing any special word to confirm that the proposal is not written by AI bot, write the special work on top of the proposal.  And don't use symbols like '‚Äî', and '1.', '2.' categorization. Also remember that don't include experience that make proposal long.
My best chance of winning this project is writing a great bid proposal here!
